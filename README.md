# my-portfolio
This is my portfolio. I have dedicated it to my love of water and the Ocean.

I mostly worked with flexbox and flex properties to create this responsive webpage. All of the links in the header correspond to a different section of the page. If you grow and shrink the window, you will see that the elements of the page respond as well (not perfectly, but somewhat).

Additionally, all of the links at the bottom of the page are functional and should direct you to the appropriate website or contact portal that they state.

Ideally, I'd like to tinker with this a bit more, but I'm very happy with the progress I've made. I think it looks pretty close to the desired result.

I did receive some help on this assignment both from a TA and a tutor when it came to my flexbox arrangement.
